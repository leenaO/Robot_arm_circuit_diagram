Robot arm circuit diagram
----------
we are going to design an Arduino Uno based Robotic Arm from some breadboards and servo motors. 

Arduino Uno is programmed to control servo motors which are serving as joints(shoulder,elbow, wrisr, gripper, and base) of Robotic arm.

This Arduino Robotic Arm can be controlled by five Potentiometer attached to it, each potentiometer is used to control each servo. You can move these servos by rotating the pots to pick some object.

Components Required
-----------
  • Arduino Uno

  • breadboard

  •	Servo Motor (5 pieces)

  • Potentiometer (5 pieces)

  • Power Supply 


Servo Motor
--------
Servo Motors are mainly used when there is a need for accurate shaft movement or position. These are not proposed for high speed applications. Servo motors are proposed for low speed, medium torque and accurate position application.  So these motors are best for designing robotic arm.
